# Supreme-Court-Transcripts
Analysis of supreme court transcripts, from 1956 to 2018. Data originally from http://scdb.wustl.edu/, combined with wikipedia data and put together by Eric Wiener at https://github.com/EricWiener/supreme-court-cases, then uploaded as a SQL repository at https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/us-supreme-court-cases by reddit user timeshn.

In this analysis I will be looking at the transcripts and attempt to answer a few simple questions:

  1) What are the most common used words ?
  2) What are the most frequent words used by the justices ?
  3) Are there any significant differences in word usage by party affiliation ?
  4) Who are/were the most vocal justices in court ? 

Keep in mind that this but scratching the data analysis possibilities of the transcripts, if you have any ideas of anything else that can be tested using this data, or of any different approaches to this data set, please don't hesitate to let me know !
