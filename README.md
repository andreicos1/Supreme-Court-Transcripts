# Supreme-Court-Transcripts
Analysis of supreme court transcripts, from 1956 to 2018. Data originally from http://scdb.wustl.edu/, combined with wikipedia data and put together by Eric Wiener at https://github.com/EricWiener/supreme-court-cases, then uploaded as a SQL repository at https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/us-supreme-court-cases by reddit user timeshn.

In this analysis I will be looking at the transcripts and attempt to answer a few simple questions:

  - What are the most frequently used words?
  - Are there any significant differences in word usage by party affiliation ?
  - Who are/were the most vocal justices in court ?
