# Supreme-Court-Transcripts
Text analysis of supreme court transcripts, from 1956 to 2018. Data originally from http://scdb.wustl.edu/,
combined with wikipedia data and put together by Eric Wiener at 
https://github.com/EricWiener/supreme-court-cases, then uploaded as a SQL repository at
https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/us-supreme-court-cases by reddit user timeshn.

Some of the questions that can be answered using this dataset are


What is the average number of people involved in a case?

How long are the hearings ? 

What are the most common used words ?

Can any differences in speech patterns between the justices be observed ?
